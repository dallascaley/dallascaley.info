Â My original plan was to create my own site from scratch to show off my abilities as a developer but I figure after 8 years in the business this is not a necessity anymore. Â These days I pretty much have to bat off recruiters like tsetse flies so now I am contented with a simple blog to put my thoughts into.\r\n\r\nSo..

(2, 1, '2013-09-01 18:41:56', '2013-09-01 18:41:56', 'One of the first things you will learn about me is that I have had a lot of jobs, I mean a LOT of jobs. Â I never put all of these jobs on my resume because it would be pointless but for those who are interested, here is \"The List\" where I will give a short explanation of each job, how long I was there and why I left.\n\n<strong>Job #1: Self-Employed, curb number painter, Age 12-ish</strong>\n\nMy dad was a sign painter so i decided when i was about 12 years old that i wanted to make money and the first thing that came to mind was re-painting peoples addresses on the curb. Â Living in Michigan these numbers would get worn off very quickly by the snow so i started to make number stencils. Â I walked around the neighborhood asking residents if they wanted their number re-painted for i think it was $5\n\nReason for quitting: Â Someone pointed out that i need a business license to do this.\n\n<strong>Job #2: Freelance Artist, All over the place, Age 14 and on...</strong>\n\nMy first freelance art job was creating a t-shirt design for a car club in Buena park called \'Unique Styles\'. I created the original color art and color-separated acetate patterns for the shirt. Since then I have also done portrait art at the street fair in Long Beach and been involved with several other art projects over the years (some of them paying gigs, some not).\n\nReason for quitting: Â I never really quit, if something interesting comes up i\'d do it again.\n\n<strong>Job #3: Figure Model, Long Beach City College, Age 17</strong>\n\nMy mother is an artist so she hooked me up with this gig. Â Basically I sat (fully clothed mind you) for about half an hour at a time while students would paint/sketch me. Â It was not an official paying job but at the end of each class every student would tip me, I usually went home with around $40 which was pretty good for me at the time.\n\nReason for quitting: Â No more work.\n\n<strong>Job #4: (first real w2 type job): Receptionist, Aquarian Realty, Anaheim, Age 18</strong>\n\nI was the receptionist for a small real estate office headed by a very very old lady (like in her 90\'s) For her i answered phones, and transcribed messages (she could barely hear anything).\n\nReason for quitting: Her son took over the business and tried to make me a telemarketer.\n\n<strong>Job #5: Real Job #2: Receptionist/Telemarketer, Â Amaro Reality, Anaheim, Age 19</strong>\n\nI left Aquarian for what I thought was another receptionist job but it also turned out to be telemarketing. Â I didn\'t stay long.\n\nReason for quitting: isn\'t it obvious?\n\n<strong>Job #6: Real Job #3: Telemarketer, Harrison Marketing, Tustin Age 19</strong>\n\nI had some friends already working for this company and they said it was a good deal, at least they paid more than minimum wage (i thing $7/hour). Â It was alright, selling insurance and that kind of thing. Â I stayed for a few months.\n\nReason for quitting: I really don\'t like telemarketing\n\n<strong>Job #7: Real Job #4: Warehouse worker, American Security Systems (somewhere around age 19-20)</strong>\n\nJust a guy in a warehouse, loading boxes and stuff.\n\nReason for quitting: I\'m five-foot-four and not muscular, this was not my type of job\n\n<strong>Job #8: Real Job #5: Tester, Peryam and Kroll, Anehiem (this is where i\'m going to stop saying my age because well...)</strong>\n\nThis is a company that does market research by inviting people to test certain products, lets see i tested whiskey, some crackers and other stuff, i can\'t remember.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t quit, I just stopped being qualified for the focus groups demographics\n\n<strong>Job #9: Real Job #6: CAD/Draftsman, McDonnell Douglas Commercial Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\n\nI got this job because when I was a kid a designed a lot of my own model airplane plans, I used those drawings to get the job. Â I worked on the MD-11 project on physical drawings/scripcoat and then later in CAD using Unigraphics Unix based CAD software (I was trained on the job). I worked here about a year.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t, but the company got taken over and my position/department removed.\n\n<strong>Job #10: Real Job #7: CAD/CAM, Boeing Corp Military Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\n\nMy old boss from McDonnell Douglas started a new team doing mostly computer aided modeling of parts for the C-17 Cargo Plane, I was selected along with most of the people from my old department to work on the new project. I did a lot of structural models as well as some electrical.\n\nReason for quitting: After 3 years of working in the aircraft industry I decided this is not the path I wanted to take in life (my Father and Uncle were both in the same industry and it didn\'t treat them well) so I quit.\n\n<strong>Job #11: Real Job #8: Night Manager, Tower Records, Anaheim</strong>\n\nI got a job at Tower records because I was in a locally successful band and wanted to work with what I love (Music). I started as a clerk and quickly rose up the ranks to Night Manager.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t really quit, i just got hired by another store\n\n<strong>Job #12: (not a real job): Musician, all over the place.</strong>\n\nI got paid for my first music gig when i was in a band called \"The Dallas Project\", Since then I have been paid for a number of gigs right up to this day (we got paid a few weeks ago to play a show).\n\nReason for quitting: I will never quit this job.\n\n<strong>Job #13: Real Job #9: Clerk, A&amp;S Bargain Books, Buena Park</strong>\n\nJust working the cash register/stocking books at this really cheap book store, Â I did this job at the same time as I worked at Tower Records which was right across the street, it was part-time.\n\nReason for quitting: The store closed\n\n<strong>Job #14: Real Job #10: Buyer, Tower Records, Long Beach</strong>\n\nI got hired as the book Buyer for the long beach Tower Records, it was a pretty cool job. Â I got to select all the books that the store carried and got in good with corporate management etc...\n\nReason for quitting: I wanted more out of my life, so I moved back in with my dad in Fullerton and started going back to school to get (another) degree.\n\n<strong>Job #15: Real Job #11: Supervisor, Warehouse Music, Anaheim</strong>\n\nI needed to make money while I went back to college so I got this job because of my prior experience. It was ok.\n\nReason for quitting: I seriously can\'t remember\n\n<strong>Job #16: Real Job #12: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Placentia</strong>\n\nThis was a second job that i had while working at the Warehouse. It was good money/part time.\n\nReason for quitting: probably car trouble, I can\'t remember.\n\n<strong>Job #17: (not a real job): Editor In Chief, Fullerton College/Hornet News Paper</strong>\n\nI did get paid a small amount for being the editor in chief of the paper for a semester. Â I got this job after rising up from contributing journalist through front page editor.

I stayed for about a year this time I think.\n\nReason for quitting: I was offered a better position at Radio Shack.\n\n<strong>Job #19: Real Job #14: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Cypress</strong>\n\nThis was a second job that I had while working at Tower. Â As you can see I was not lazy.\n\nReason for quitting: The Radio Shack job was far away so I quit both to go work it.\n\n<strong>Job #20 Real Job #15: Sales Associate, Radio Shack, Pico Rivera</strong>\n\nI took this job because they said after a few months I would get my own store. Â This is the only reason I took the job. Â It sucked!, I was the only person in the store who actually knew anything about electronics/components or computers so I got stuck selling all the $2 capacitors while everyone else hocked cell phones for big commissions.\n\nReason for quitting: I refused to completely rob an old lady by selling here Â a $10 restock old-cellphone and tacking on $90 worth of accessories which she didn\'t ask for.

Â Brian Haddad (my old manager who asked me to do this) you are a completely unethical jerk and I hope you are still stuck in retail hell.\n\n<strong>Job #21: Real Job #16: Cell Phone Sales, MCI Wireless, Brea Mall</strong>\n\nI think I literally got hired at this job on the very same day that I walked out of Radio Shack. Â I was one of those annoying guys in the mall who tries to sell you a new phone when you walk by. Â This job sucked so bad that in the two weeks I worked there I went from being the newest guy to the oldest. Â Literally everyone else in the booth either quit or got fired.\n\nReason for quitting: It sucked, I called a buddy at Crown Books and got a new job.\n\n<strong>Job #22: Real Job #17: Store Manager, Crown Books Whittier</strong>\n\nFirst, this is not the Crown Books you are familiar with. Â The company A &amp; S Bargain Books simply bought the name after Crown folded. Â Their business model was to move into vacant retail locations with a temporary lease, we would get a good deal on rent but we could get kicked out at any time. Â Our job was to throw as many books on the shelves as possible and sell them before the store closed. Â There was no inventory, no computers, just a price gun and a register. I had about 5 employees and my store stayed open for about a year.\n\nReason for quitting: I needed a vacation\n\n<strong>Job #23: Real Job #18: Paint Department, Home Depot Anaheim</strong>\n\nThis was my second job while I worked at Crown Books. Â Because of my father\'s business I was familiar with paint so I got the job. Â It was ok. Â This job was essentially a means to an end (to take a vacation) I was there a few months.\n\nReason for quitting: I quit both Crown Books and this job to take a three week road trip across our beautiful nation. Â It was totally worth it.\n\n<strong>Job #24: Real Job #19: Delivery Truck Driver, Simpson Buick, Buena Park</strong>\n\nI drove a stake bed truck all over the LA/OC area delivering car parts to various service shops. Â I enjoyed this job because I was out in the city most of the day.\n\nReason for quitting: I had a minor accident, backed into some moron who parked right behind my truck as I was idling, It would have been no big deal but they were going to take the damages out of my check and since I wasn\'t making much in the first place I decided to quit.\n\n<strong>Job #25: Real Job #20: Taxi Driver, A-Taxi, Santa Ana</strong>\n\nThis was my first cab driving job, I worked mostly in the bar districts of either Newport Beach or Fullerton.\n\nReason for quitting: The cars were really badly maintained and every time you broke down they would take hours to get to you and then repay you by adding more time at the end of your 24 hour lease (which was useless if you were out of commission during peak bar hours and replenished with extra hours on a Sunday afternoon).\n\n<strong>Job #26: Real Job #21: Taxi Driver, Yellow Cab, Anaheim</strong>\n\nA much better company than A-Taxi, I drove for Yellow Cab for 3 years. Â The great thing about cab driving is you make your own hours so it allowed me to do other jobs at the same time.\n\nReason for quitting: In my third year of driving I drove less and less, my other business ventures were more profitable.\n\n<strong>Job #27: Real Job #22: Retail, Cost Plus World Market, Brea</strong>\n\nI had a friend who worked there. Â I worked for a few months but it was boring and didn\'t pay much.\n\nReason for quitting: who cares? really?\n\n<strong>Job #28: Real Job #23: Small Business Owner, Pearshapeboy Apparel, Fullerton</strong>\n\nEven though this was my own business I count it as a real job since I had a business license and I paid taxes. Â I set up shop in my dads warehouse with a hand made 4-color T-Shirt press. Â I only made a few thousand dollars with this but it was fun.\n\nReason for quitting: to take over my dads business\n\n<strong>Job #29: Real Job #24: Phone Sales/Support, Wine Country Gift Baskets, La Habra</strong>\n\nThis was a seasonal job that I took because friends of mine said it was a good company. Â It was. Â The work was hard/tedious but it paid very well and had a very good bonus plan.\n\nReason for quitting: Seasonal and to take over my dads business\n\n<strong>Job #30: Real Job #25: Awning Graphics Painter, JCI International, Fullerton/Santa Fe Springs</strong>\n\nThis was what was left of my dads business of 30 years on and off. He had established himself as one of the sole awning graphics manufacturers in the OC area. Â After he took ill i took over the business and ran it for many years. Â My work can bee seen on hundreds of buildings throughout southern California. Â Notable Businesses include, Pulte Homes, Lennar, KB Home, Cost Plus World Markets (ironically), and about 80% of the bars in Fullerton at one point.\n\nReason for quitting: Work was inconsistent, I had gotten married and needed something I could depend on.\n\n<strong>Job #31: Real Job #26: Computer/Office Relocation Services, InnerVision, Orange/LA County</strong>\n\nThis company specialized in moving offices, Things like tearing down/setting up workstations etc... Â it was ok but not that ok. Â This was my first attempt to get a \"real job\" ie a job in an office.\n\nReason for quitting: The job was inconsistent, I got another job\n\n<strong>Job #32: Real Job #27: Retail, Office Depot, Buena Park</strong>\n\nJust another retail job. Â I thought somehow this job would get me closer to landing an \"office job\" which is what my goal became. I had it in my mind that if i got into an office things would become easier. Â This turned out to be true.\n\nReason for quitting: I got an office job\n\n<strong>Â Job #33: Real Job #28: Webmaster/IT Manager, Vinotemp Wine Cellars, Rancho Dominguez</strong>\n\nThis is the job that really started my \"Career\". I applied for a job as an Administrative Assistant however it only took them a month or so to realize that I knew a bit about web development so they gave me the job of Â maintaining all of their websites (vinotemp.com, westsidewinecellars.com, winemate.com). I was also put in charge of the local computer network and also responsible for creating all print materials. Â I also connected the system via EDI to several other companies including Home Depot and Walmart. I did the best I could for them working on a very hacked up os-commerce site and I made a completely new winemate.com however it was fairly clear after a year or so with them that they had bigger problems than I could handle so they went ahead and hired a second web developer with much more experience.\n\nReason for quitting: I was fired for not showing up the day after Christmas (a Friday that year). Â This is the first and only time I\'ve ever been fired from a job. Â They had a company policy of no days off in November and December and I violated that policy. Â It was clearly my fault however I think the real reason they got rid of me is they didn\'t need me with the new developer and I gave them a valid reason. Â I have no hard feelings towards them as they did get me going in the right direction.\n\n<strong>Job #34: Real Job #29: Webmaster/Marketing Manager, Shaxon Industries, Anaheim</strong>\n\nShaxon was a mid-sized manufacturing company that primarily made copper and fiber optic cables for a variety of uses. Â I had many duties there including making all the print materials and maintaining several websites. Â Even with all that they gave me work wise I had plenty of time on my hands so in that time I completely re-designed their main site (from scratch mind you, no frameworks). Â The new site I made them was able to be white-labeled (skinned) so that their clients could also use it with their company logo/colors etc.. Â It was much better that the archaic 1990\'s looking site which they still have online now however the owners of the company were simply not interested, It was the general manager who had me working on the project and apparently after I left he could not convince them of the worth of a new site because the old one is still live... Â sad.\n\nReason for leaving: Found a better job where they valued my web design skills\n\n<strong>Job #35: Real Job #30: Application Developer, After 10 Studios, Santa Monica</strong>\n\nI started working for this company about a month before I quit Shaxon. Â We were a small web development agency and my first project was the dashboard of a vehicle tracking system used by Viper Smart Start and a few other brand name tracking devices. Â The application grew to be fairly extensive by the time we were done, Integrating with Bing Maps, and with a full customer management/accounting and scheduling component. Â After this project was done I worked on about a dozen other projects including: Guardian Watch (a web/mobile app for emergency responders), Gymji (a social network for gym goers), Push It Poker (a social Poker App) and many more. After 10 is where I first started using object oriented programing techniques and also frameworks like Kohana, Cake PHP and CodeIgniter.\n\nUnfortunately the owners of the company over-extended our resources towards the end. Â We had about 60-70 projects and only 3-4 developers in-house so instead of having us develop code ourselves we became project managers for teams of over-seas developers (mainly in Russia). Â I did not like this situation as I love coding so I began to look for a new job after about 2 years. Â The company ended up folding a few months after I left\n\nReason for leaving: Bad management.\n\n<strong>Job #36: Real Job #31: PHP Developer II, Hautelook, Los Angeles</strong>\n\nHautelook is an online fashion \"Flash Sales\" site meaning that sales are scheduled every day and have a very defined timeline. Â With over $300,000,000 in annual sales after only 5 years in business they are one of the most successful in their market, so much so that they were purchased by their competitor Nordstroms a few years back because Nordstroms (a 100 year old company with 20 billion in annual sales) could not compete.\n\nWorking for the engineering teem at Hautelook was like working for a bunch of computer science professors. Â They took proper coding standards to the extreme in some cases but for me (not having gone to college for this kind of thing) it was probably the best training I could ever get. I learned about design patterns and Unit Testing and Test Driven Development among other things while using primarily the Zend Framework.\n\nAnother amazing thing about this company was the culture of learning. Â Once a month someone from the team would have to do a presentation to the rest of the team about something they had learned. Â We even had a two week period where all development stopped and we all (besides the iOS developers) learned how to code in Objective C and make our own iOS apps. Â We did this because there was a disconnect between the iOS team and the rest of development. Â The backend developers such as myself did not understand the data structures that the iOS team required because we had never worked in a strictly typed language. Â This was a very good idea.\n\nMy major achievement while working for HL was the complete redesign of the returns processing system. Â This system is integrated with the admin site, credit card processing, shipping and warehousing. Â It touches just about every aspect of the site and at last time I checked was processing about $4,000,000 dollars in returns per month. Â I also worked on various shipping/tracking modules, paypal/bill-me-later and other payment gateways, and other back and front end projects.\n\nReason for leaving: Â The drive from Santa Ana to Los Angeles downtown was killing me\n\n<strong>Job #37: Real Job #32: Senior Developer, Baublebox, Brea</strong>\n\nI took the job at Baublebox because it seemed like a good opportunity. Â The site was very similar to Hautelook (flash sales) but only a few months old. Â They also said I would pretty much be the CTO when the company got bigger and they offered me stock options. Â Things went downhill very quick. Â The owner had some ridiculous expectation of improving sales by 70% month to month and I could tell that either this would not happen, or it would and the site would not be able to handle it. Â After a few weeks I determined that the site was so horribly written that it needed to pretty much be thrown out and a new one started, however with my team of one other partially qualified developer this was not going to happen in the time needed. Â I literally took the first job that I was offered just to get out. Â (Stay tuned to a future blog where I go into the details of why this site was so bad)\n\nReason for leaving: When faced with an impossible to achieve task, change the requirements.\n\n<strong>Job #38: Real Job #33: Software Development Manager: PlatinumMD/SkyCare EHR, Santa Ana</strong>\n\nSkyCare was a full featured web-based Electronic Health Records application.

Â I never put all of these jobs on my resume because it would be pointless but for those who are interested, here is \"The List\" where I will give a short explanation of each job, how long I was there and why I left.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #1: Self-Employed, curb number painter, Age 12-ish</strong>\r\n\r\nMy dad was a sign painter so i decided when i was about 12 years old that i wanted to make money and the first thing that came to mind was re-painting peoples addresses on the curb. Â Living in Michigan these numbers would get worn off very quickly by the snow so i started to make number stencils. Â I walked around the neighborhood asking residents if they wanted their number re-painted for i think it was $5\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Â Someone pointed out that i need a business license to do this.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #2: Freelance Artist, All over the place, Age 14 and on...</strong>\r\n\r\nMy first freelance art job was creating a t-shirt design for a car club in Buena park called \'Unique Styles\'. I created the original color art and color-separated acetate patterns for the shirt. Since then I have also done portrait art at the street fair in Long Beach and been involved with several other art projects over the years (some of them paying gigs, some not).\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Â I never really quit, if something interesting comes up i\'d do it again.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #3: Figure Model, Long Beach City College, Age 17</strong>\r\n\r\nMy mother is an artist so she hooked me up with this gig. Â Basically I sat (fully clothed mind you) for about half an hour at a time while students would paint/sketch me. Â It was not an official paying job but at the end of each class every student would tip me, I usually went home with around $40 which was pretty good for me at the time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Â No more work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #4: (first real w2 type job): Receptionist, Aquarian Realty, Anaheim, Age 18</strong>\r\n\r\nI was the receptionist for a small real estate office headed by a very very old lady (like in her 90\'s) For her i answered phones, and transcribed messages (she could barely hear anything).\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Her son took over the business and tried to make me a telemarketer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #5: Real Job #2: Receptionist/Telemarketer, Â Amaro Reality, Anaheim, Age 19</strong>\r\n\r\nI left Aquarian for what I thought was another receptionist job but it also turned out to be telemarketing. Â I didn\'t stay long.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: isn\'t it obvious?\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #6: Real Job #3: Telemarketer, Harrison Marketing, Tustin Age 19</strong>\r\n\r\nI had some friends already working for this company and they said it was a good deal, at least they paid more than minimum wage (i thing $7/hour). Â It was alright, selling insurance and that kind of thing. Â I stayed for a few months.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I really don\'t like telemarketing\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #7: Real Job #4: Warehouse worker, American Security Systems (somewhere around age 19-20)</strong>\r\n\r\nJust a guy in a warehouse, loading boxes and stuff.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I\'m five-foot-four and not muscular, this was not my type of job\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #8: Real Job #5: Tester, Peryam and Kroll, Anehiem (this is where i\'m going to stop saying my age because well...)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a company that does market research by inviting people to test certain products, lets see i tested whiskey, some crackers and other stuff, i can\'t remember.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t quit, I just stopped being qualified for the focus groups demographics\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #9: Real Job #6: CAD/Draftsman, McDonnell Douglas Commercial Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nI got this job because when I was a kid a designed a lot of my own model airplane plans, I used those drawings to get the job. Â I worked on the MD-11 project on physical drawings/scripcoat and then later in CAD using Unigraphics Unix based CAD software (I was trained on the job). I worked here about a year.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t, but the company got taken over and my position/department removed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #10: Real Job #7: CAD/CAM, Boeing Corp Military Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nMy old boss from McDonnell Douglas started a new team doing mostly computer aided modeling of parts for the C-17 Cargo Plane, I was selected along with most of the people from my old department to work on the new project. I did a lot of structural models as well as some electrical.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: After 3 years of working in the aircraft industry I decided this is not the path I wanted to take in life (my Father and Uncle were both in the same industry and it didn\'t treat them well) so I quit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #11: Real Job #8: Night Manager, Tower Records, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nI got a job at Tower records because I was in a locally successful band and wanted to work with what I love (Music). I started as a clerk and quickly rose up the ranks to Night Manager.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t really quit, i just got hired by another store\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #12: (not a real job): Musician, all over the place.</strong>\r\n\r\nI got paid for my first music gig when i was in a band called \"The Dallas Project\", Since then I have been paid for a number of gigs right up to this day (we got paid a few weeks ago to play a show).\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I will never quit this job.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #13: Real Job #9: Clerk, A&amp;S Bargain Books, Buena Park</strong>\r\n\r\nJust working the cash register/stocking books at this really cheap book store, Â I did this job at the same time as I worked at Tower Records which was right across the street, it was part-time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The store closed\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #14: Real Job #10: Buyer, Tower Records, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nI got hired as the book Buyer for the long beach Tower Records, it was a pretty cool job. Â I got to select all the books that the store carried and got in good with corporate management etc...\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I wanted more out of my life, so I moved back in with my dad in Fullerton and started going back to school to get (another) degree.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #15: Real Job #11: Supervisor, Warehouse Music, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nI needed to make money while I went back to college so I got this job because of my prior experience.

I applied for a job as an Administrative Assistant however it only took them a month or so to realize that I knew a bit about web development so they gave me the job of Â maintaining all of their websites (vinotemp.com, westsidewinecellars.com, winemate.com). I was also put in charge of the local computer network and also responsible for creating all print materials. Â I also connected the system via EDI to several other companies including Home Depot and Walmart. I did the best I could for them working on a very hacked up os-commerce site and I made a completely new winemate.com however it was fairly clear after a year or so with them that they had bigger problems than I could handle so they went ahead and hired a second web developer with much more experience.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I was fired for not showing up the day after Christmas (a Friday that year). Â This is the first and only time I\'ve ever been fired from a job. Â They had a company policy of no days off in November and December and I violated that policy. Â It was clearly my fault however I think the real reason they got rid of me is they didn\'t need me with the new developer and I gave them a valid reason. Â I have no hard feelings towards them as they did get me going in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #34: Real Job #29: Webmaster/Marketing Manager, Shaxon Industries, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nShaxon was a mid-sized manufacturing company that primarily made copper and fiber optic cables for a variety of uses. Â I had many duties there including making all the print materials and maintaining several websites. Â Even with all that they gave me work wise I had plenty of time on my hands so in that time I completely re-designed their main site (from scratch mind you, no frameworks). Â The new site I made them was able to be white-labeled (skinned) so that their clients could also use it with their company logo/colors etc.. Â It was much better that the archaic 1990\'s looking site which they still have online now however the owners of the company were simply not interested, It was the general manager who had me working on the project and apparently after I left he could not convince them of the worth of a new site because the old one is still live... Â sad.\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Found a better job where they valued my web design skills\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #35: Real Job #30: Application Developer, After 10 Studios, Santa Monica</strong>\r\n\r\nI started working for this company about a month before I quit Shaxon. Â We were a small web development agency and my first project was the dashboard of a vehicle tracking system used by Viper Smart Start and a few other brand name tracking devices. Â The application grew to be fairly extensive by the time we were done, Integrating with Bing Maps, and with a full customer management/accounting and scheduling component. Â After this project was done I worked on about a dozen other projects including: Guardian Watch (a web/mobile app for emergency responders), Gymji (a social network for gym goers), Push It Poker (a social Poker App) and many more. After 10 is where I first started using object oriented programing techniques and also frameworks like Kohana, Cake PHP and CodeIgniter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the owners of the company over-extended our resources towards the end. Â We had about 60-70 projects and only 3-4 developers in-house so instead of having us develop code ourselves we became project managers for teams of over-seas developers (mainly in Russia). Â I did not like this situation as I love coding so I began to look for a new job after about 2 years. Â The company ended up folding a few months after I left\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Bad management.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #36: Real Job #31: PHP Developer II, Hautelook, Los Angeles</strong>\r\n\r\nHautelook is an online fashion \"Flash Sales\" site meaning that sales are scheduled every day and have a very defined timeline. Â With over $300,000,000 in annual sales after only 5 years in business they are one of the most successful in their market, so much so that they were purchased by their competitor Nordstroms a few years back because Nordstroms (a 100 year old company with 20 billion in annual sales) could not compete.\r\n\r\nWorking for the engineering teem at Hautelook was like working for a bunch of computer science professors. Â They took proper coding standards to the extreme in some cases but for me (not having gone to college for this kind of thing) it was probably the best training I could ever get. I learned about design patterns and Unit Testing and Test Driven Development among other things while using primarily the Zend Framework.\r\n\r\nAnother amazing thing about this company was the culture of learning. Â Once a month someone from the team would have to do a presentation to the rest of the team about something they had learned. Â We even had a two week period where all development stopped and we all (besides the iOS developers) learned how to code in Objective C and make our own iOS apps. Â We did this because there was a disconnect between the iOS team and the rest of development. Â The backend developers such as myself did not understand the data structures that the iOS team required because we had never worked in a strictly typed language. Â This was a very good idea.\r\n\r\nMy major achievement while working for HL was the complete redesign of the returns processing system. Â This system is integrated with the admin site, credit card processing, shipping and warehousing. Â It touches just about every aspect of the site and at last time I checked was processing about $4,000,000 dollars in returns per month. Â I also worked on various shipping/tracking modules, paypal/bill-me-later and other payment gateways, and other back and front end projects.\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Â The drive from Santa Ana to Los Angeles downtown was killing me\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #37: Real Job #32: Senior Developer, Baublebox, Brea</strong>\r\n\r\nI took the job at Baublebox because it seemed like a good opportunity. Â The site was very similar to Hautelook (flash sales) but only a few months old. Â They also said I would pretty much be the CTO when the company got bigger and they offered me stock options. Â Things went downhill very quick. Â The owner had some ridiculous expectation of improving sales by 70% month to month and I could tell that either this would not happen, or it would and the site would not be able to handle it. Â After a few weeks I determined that the site was so horribly written that it needed to pretty much be thrown out and a new one started, however with my team of one other partially qualified developer this was not going to happen in the time needed. Â I literally took the first job that I was offered just to get out. Â (Stay tuned to a future blog where I go into the details of why this site was so bad)\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: When faced with an impossible to achieve task, change the requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #38: Real Job #33: Software Development Manager: PlatinumMD/SkyCare EHR, Santa Ana</strong>\r\n\r\nSkyCare was a full featured web-based Electronic Health Records application.

(7, 1, '2013-09-02 18:09:16', '2013-09-02 18:09:16', 'One of the first things you will learn about me is that I have had a lot of jobs, I mean a LOT of jobs. Â I never put all of these jobs on my resume because it would be pointless but for those who are interested, here is \"The List\" where I will give a short explanation of each job, how long I was there and why I left.\n\n<strong>Job #1: Self-Employed, curb number painter, Age 12-ish</strong>\n\nMy dad was a sign painter so i decided when i was about 12 years old that i wanted to make money and the first thing that came to mind was re-painting peoples addresses on the curb. Â Living in Michigan these numbers would get worn off very quickly by the snow so i started to make number stencils. Â I walked around the neighborhood asking residents if they wanted their number re-painted for i think it was $5\n\nReason for quitting: Â Someone pointed out that i need a business license to do this.\n\n<strong>Job #2: Freelance Artist, All over the place, Age 14 and on...</strong>\n\nMy first freelance art job was creating a t-shirt design for a car club in Buena park called \'Unique Styles\'. I created the original color art and color-separated acetate patterns for the shirt. Since then I have also done portrait art at the street fair in Long Beach and been involved with several other art projects over the years (some of them paying gigs, some not).\n\nReason for quitting: Â I never really quit, if something interesting comes up i\'d do it again.\n\n<strong>Job #3: Figure Model, Long Beach City College, Age 17</strong>\n\nMy mother is an artist so she hooked me up with this gig. Â Basically I sat (fully clothed mind you) for about half an hour at a time while students would paint/sketch me. Â It was not an official paying job but at the end of each class every student would tip me, I usually went home with around $40 which was pretty good for me at the time.\n\nReason for quitting: Â No more work.\n\n<strong>Job #4: (first real w2 type job): Receptionist, Aquarian Realty, Anaheim, Age 18</strong>\n\nI was the receptionist for a small real estate office headed by a very very old lady (like in her 90\'s) For her i answered phones, and transcribed messages (she could barely hear anything).\n\nReason for quitting: Her son took over the business and tried to make me a telemarketer.\n\n<strong>Job #5: Real Job #2: Receptionist/Telemarketer, Â Amaro Reality, Anaheim, Age 19</strong>\n\nI left Aquarian for what I thought was another receptionist job but it also turned out to be telemarketing. Â I didn\'t stay long.\n\nReason for quitting: isn\'t it obvious?\n\n<strong>Job #6: Real Job #3: Telemarketer, Harrison Marketing, Tustin Age 19</strong>\n\nI had some friends already working for this company and they said it was a good deal, at least they paid more than minimum wage (i thing $7/hour). Â It was alright, selling insurance and that kind of thing. Â I stayed for a few months.\n\nReason for quitting: I really don\'t like telemarketing\n\n<strong>Job #7: Real Job #4: Warehouse worker, American Security Systems (somewhere around age 19-20)</strong>\n\nJust a guy in a warehouse, loading boxes and stuff.\n\nReason for quitting: I\'m five-foot-four and not muscular, this was not my type of job\n\n<strong>Job #8: Real Job #5: Tester, Peryam and Kroll, Anehiem (this is where i\'m going to stop saying my age because well...)</strong>\n\nThis is a company that does market research by inviting people to test certain products, lets see i tested whiskey, some crackers and other stuff, i can\'t remember.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t quit, I just stopped being qualified for the focus groups demographics\n\n<strong>Job #9: Real Job #6: CAD/Draftsman, McDonnell Douglas Commercial Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\n\nI got this job because when I was a kid a designed a lot of my own model airplane plans, I used those drawings to get the job. Â I worked on the MD-11 project on physical drawings/scripcoat and then later in CAD using Unigraphics Unix based CAD software (I was trained on the job). I worked here about a year.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t, but the company got taken over and my position/department removed.\n\n<strong>Job #10: Real Job #7: CAD/CAM, Boeing Corp Military Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\n\nMy old boss from McDonnell Douglas started a new team doing mostly computer aided modeling of parts for the C-17 Cargo Plane, I was selected along with most of the people from my old department to work on the new project. I did a lot of structural models as well as some electrical.\n\nReason for quitting: After 3 years of working in the aircraft industry I decided this is not the path I wanted to take in life (my Father and Uncle were both in the same industry and it didn\'t treat them well) so I quit.\n\n<strong>Job #11: Real Job #8: Night Manager, Tower Records, Anaheim</strong>\n\nI got a job at Tower records because I was in a locally successful band and wanted to work with what I love (Music). I started as a clerk and quickly rose up the ranks to Night Manager.\n\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t really quit, i just got hired by another store\n\n<strong>Job #12: (not a real job): Musician, all over the place.</strong>\n\nI got paid for my first music gig when i was in a band called \"The Dallas Project\", Since then I have been paid for a number of gigs right up to this day (we got paid a few weeks ago to play a show).\n\nReason for quitting: I will never quit this job.\n\n<strong>Job #13: Real Job #9: Clerk, A&amp;S Bargain Books, Buena Park</strong>\n\nJust working the cash register/stocking books at this really cheap book store, Â I did this job at the same time as I worked at Tower Records which was right across the street, it was part-time.\n\nReason for quitting: The store closed\n\n<strong>Job #14: Real Job #10: Buyer, Tower Records, Long Beach</strong>\n\nI got hired as the book Buyer for the long beach Tower Records, it was a pretty cool job. Â I got to select all the books that the store carried and got in good with corporate management etc...\n\nReason for quitting: I wanted more out of my life, so I moved back in with my dad in Fullerton and started going back to school to get (another) degree.\n\n<strong>Job #15: Real Job #11: Supervisor, Warehouse Music, Anaheim</strong>\n\nI needed to make money while I went back to college so I got this job because of my prior experience. It was ok.\n\nReason for quitting: I seriously can\'t remember\n\n<strong>Job #16: Real Job #12: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Placentia</strong>\n\nThis was a second job that i had while working at the Warehouse. It was good money/part time.\n\nReason for quitting: probably car trouble, I can\'t remember.\n\n<strong>Job #17: (not a real job): Editor In Chief, Fullerton College/Hornet News Paper</strong>\n\nI did get paid a small amount for being the editor in chief of the paper for a semester. Â I got this job after rising up from contributing journalist through front page editor. (This is where I learned photoshop and layout, yay!)\n\nReason for quitting: I wanted to pursue a story about our department head getting sued for some reason. Â It was the only real news on campus but they wouldn\'t let me. Â When I quit most of the other writers also quit in solidarity.\n\n<em>Side note: It was around about this time in my life that I started really getting into programming. Â I started by making web pages for myself, my band and other friends of mine for art projects. It didn\'t occur to me at the time that this would lead into a full-on career in the field.</em>\n\n<strong>Job #18: Real Job #13: Merchandiser, Tower Records Anaheim</strong>\n\nI went back to Tower Records because I still had a lot of friends there. I stayed for about a year this time I think.\n\nReason for quitting: I was offered a better position at Radio Shack.\n\n<strong>Job #19: Real Job #14: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Cypress</strong>\n\nThis was a second job that I had while working at Tower. Â As you can see I was not lazy.\n\nReason for quitting: The Radio Shack job was far away so I quit both to go work it.\n\n<strong>Job #20 Real Job #15: Sales Associate, Radio Shack, Pico Rivera</strong>\n\nI took this job because they said after a few months I would get my own store. Â This is the only reason I took the job. Â It sucked!, I was the only person in the store who actually knew anything about electronics/components or computers so I got stuck selling all the $2 capacitors while everyone else hocked cell phones for big commissions.\n\nReason for quitting: I refused to completely rob an old lady by selling here Â a $10 restock old-cellphone and tacking on $90 worth of accessories which she didn\'t ask for. Â I flat out refused to do it. Â I quit this job by going to lunch and never returning. Â Brian Haddad (my old manager who asked me to do this) you are a completely unethical jerk and I hope you are still stuck in retail hell.\n\n<strong>Job #21: Real Job #16: Cell Phone Sales, MCI Wireless, Brea Mall</strong>\n\nI think I literally got hired at this job on the very same day that I walked out of Radio Shack. Â I was one of those annoying guys in the mall who tries to sell you a new phone when you walk by. Â This job sucked so bad that in the two weeks I worked there I went from being the newest guy to the oldest. Â Literally everyone else in the booth either quit or got fired.\n\nReason for quitting: It sucked, I called a buddy at Crown Books and got a new job.\n\n<strong>Job #22: Real Job #17: Store Manager, Crown Books Whittier</strong>\n\nFirst, this is not the Crown Books you are familiar with. Â The company A &amp; S Bargain Books simply bought the name after Crown folded. Â Their business model was to move into vacant retail locations with a temporary lease, we would get a good deal on rent but we could get kicked out at any time. Â Our job was to throw as many books on the shelves as possible and sell them before the store closed. Â There was no inventory, no computers, just a price gun and a register. I had about 5 employees and my store stayed open for about a year.\n\nReason for quitting: I needed a vacation\n\n<strong>Job #23: Real Job #18: Paint Department, Home Depot Anaheim</strong>\n\nThis was my second job while I worked at Crown Books. Â Because of my father\'s business I was familiar with paint so I got the job. Â It was ok. Â This job was essentially a means to an end (to take a vacation) I was there a few months.\n\nReason for quitting: I quit both Crown Books and this job to take a three week road trip across our beautiful nation. Â It was totally worth it.\n\n<strong>Job #24: Real Job #19: Delivery Truck Driver, Simpson Buick, Buena Park</strong>\n\nI drove a stake bed truck all over the LA/OC area delivering car parts to various service shops. Â I enjoyed this job because I was out in the city most of the day.\n\nReason for quitting: I had a minor accident, backed into some moron who parked right behind my truck as I was idling, It would have been no big deal but they were going to take the damages out of my check and since I wasn\'t making much in the first place I decided to quit.\n\n<strong>Job #25: Real Job #20: Taxi Driver, A-Taxi, Santa Ana</strong>\n\nThis was my first cab driving job, I worked mostly in the bar districts of either Newport Beach or Fullerton.\n\nReason for quitting: The cars were really badly maintained and every time you broke down they would take hours to get to you and then repay you by adding more time at the end of your 24 hour lease (which was useless if you were out of commission during peak bar hours and replenished with extra hours on a Sunday afternoon).\n\n<strong>Job #26: Real Job #21: Taxi Driver, Yellow Cab, Anaheim</strong>\n\nA much better company than A-Taxi, I drove for Yellow Cab for 3 years. Â The great thing about cab driving is you make your own hours so it allowed me to do other jobs at the same time.\n\nReason for quitting: In my third year of driving I drove less and less, my other business ventures were more profitable.\n\n<strong>Job #27: Real Job #22: Retail, Cost Plus World Market, Brea</strong>\n\nI had a friend who worked there. Â I worked for a few months but it was boring and didn\'t pay much.\n\nReason for quitting: who cares? really?\n\n<strong>Job #28: Real Job #23: Small Business Owner, Pearshapeboy Apparel, Fullerton</strong>\n\nEven though this was my own business I count it as a real job since I had a business license and I paid taxes. Â I set up shop in my dads warehouse with a hand made 4-color T-Shirt press. Â I only made a few thousand dollars with this but it was fun.\n\nReason for quitting: to take over my dads business\n\n<strong>Job #29: Real Job #24: Phone Sales/Support, Wine Country Gift Baskets, La Habra</strong>\n\nThis was a seasonal job that I took because friends of mine said it was a good company. Â It was. Â The work was hard/tedious but it paid very well and had a very good bonus plan.\n\nReason for quitting: Seasonal and to take over my dads business\n\n<strong>Job #30: Real Job #25: Awning Graphics Painter, JCI International, Fullerton/Santa Fe Springs</strong>\n\nThis was what was left of my dads business of 30 years on and off. He had established himself as one of the sole awning graphics manufacturers in the OC area. Â After he took ill i took over the business and ran it for many years. Â My work can bee seen on hundreds of buildings throughout southern California. Â Notable Businesses include, Pulte Homes, Lennar, KB Home, Cost Plus World Markets (ironically), and about 80% of the bars in Fullerton at one point.\n\nReason for quitting: Work was inconsistent, I had gotten married and needed something I could depend on.\n\n<strong>Job #31: Real Job #26: Computer/Office Relocation Services, InnerVision, Orange/LA County</strong>\n\nThis company specialized in moving offices, Things like tearing down/setting up workstations etc... Â it was ok but not that ok. Â This was my first attempt to get a \"real job\" ie a job in an office.\n\nReason for quitting: The job was inconsistent, I got another job\n\n<strong>Job #32: Real Job #27: Retail, Office Depot, Buena Park</strong>\n\nJust another retail job. Â I thought somehow this job would get me closer to landing an \"office job\" which is what my goal became. I had it in my mind that if i got into an office things would become easier. Â This turned out to be true.\n\nReason for quitting: I got an office job\n\n<strong>Â Job #33: Real Job #28: Webmaster/IT Manager, Vinotemp Wine Cellars, Rancho Dominguez</strong>\n\nThis is the job that really started my \"Career\". I applied for a job as an Administrative Assistant however it only took them a month or so to realize that I knew a bit about web development so they gave me the job of Â maintaining all of their websites (vinotemp.com, westsidewinecellars.com, winemate.com). I was also put in charge of the local computer network and also responsible for creating all print materials. Â I also connected the system via EDI to several other companies including Home Depot and Walmart. I did the best I could for them working on a very hacked up os-commerce site and I made a completely new winemate.com however it was fairly clear after a year or so with them that they had bigger problems than I could handle so they went ahead and hired a second web developer with much more experience.\n\nReason for quitting: I was fired for not showing up the day after Christmas (a Friday that year). Â This is the first and only time I\'ve ever been fired from a job. Â They had a company policy of no days off in November and December and I violated that policy. Â It was clearly my fault however I think the real reason they got rid of me is they didn\'t need me with the new developer and I gave them a valid reason. Â I have no hard feelings towards them as they did get me going in the right direction.\n\n<strong>Job #34: Real Job #29: Webmaster/Marketing Manager, Shaxon Industries, Anaheim</strong>\n\nShaxon was a mid-sized manufacturing company that primarily made copper and fiber optic cables for a variety of uses. Â I had many duties there including making all the print materials and maintaining several websites. Â Even with all that they gave me work wise I had plenty of time on my hands so in that time I completely re-designed their main site (from scratch mind you, no frameworks). Â The new site I made them was able to be white-labeled (skinned) so that their clients could also use it with their company logo/colors etc.. Â It was much better that the archaic 1990\'s looking site which they still have online now however the owners of the company were simply not interested, It was the general manager who had me working on the project and apparently after I left he could not convince them of the worth of a new site because the old one is still live... Â sad.\n\nReason for leaving: Found a better job where they valued my web design skills\n\n<strong>Job #35: Real Job #30: Application Developer, After 10 Studios, Santa Monica</strong>\n\nI started working for this company about a month before I quit Shaxon. Â We were a small web development agency and my first project was the dashboard of a vehicle tracking system used by Viper Smart Start and a few other brand name tracking devices. Â The application grew to be fairly extensive by the time we were done, Integrating with Bing Maps, and with a full customer management/accounting and scheduling component. Â After this project was done I worked on about a dozen other projects including: Guardian Watch (a web/mobile app for emergency responders), Gymji (a social network for gym goers), Push It Poker (a social Poker App) and many more. After 10 is where I first started using object oriented programing techniques and also frameworks like Kohana, Cake PHP and CodeIgniter.\n\nUnfortunately the owners of the company over-extended our resources towards the end. Â We had about 60-70 projects and only 3-4 developers in-house so instead of having us develop code ourselves we became project managers for teams of over-seas developers (mainly in Russia). Â I did not like this situation as I love coding so I began to look for a new job after about 2 years. Â The company ended up folding a few months after I left\n\nReason for leaving: Bad management.\n\n<strong>Job #36: Real Job #31: PHP Developer II, Hautelook, Los Angeles</strong>\n\nHautelook is an online fashion \"Flash Sales\" site meaning that sales are scheduled every day and have a very defined timeline. Â With over $300,000,000 in annual sales after only 5 years in business they are one of the most successful in their market, so much so that they were purchased by their competitor Nordstroms a few years back because Nordstroms (a 100 year old company with 20 billion in annual sales) could not compete.\n\nWorking for the engineering teem at Hautelook was like working for a bunch of computer science professors. Â They took proper coding standards to the extreme in some cases but for me (not having gone to college for this kind of thing) it was probably the best training I could ever get. I learned about design patterns and Unit Testing and Test Driven Development among other things while using primarily the Zend Framework.\n\nAnother amazing thing about this company was the culture of learning. Â Once a month someone from the team would have to do a presentation to the rest of the team about something they had learned. Â We even had a two week period where all development stopped and we all (besides the iOS developers) learned how to code in Objective C and make our own iOS apps. Â We did this because there was a disconnect between the iOS team and the rest of development. Â The backend developers such as myself did not understand the data structures that the iOS team required because we had never worked in a strictly typed language. Â This was a very good idea.\n\nMy major achievement while working for HL was the complete redesign of the returns processing system. Â This system is integrated with the admin site, credit card processing, shipping and warehousing. Â It touches just about every aspect of the site and at last time I checked was processing about $4,000,000 dollars in returns per month. Â I also worked on various shipping/tracking modules, paypal/bill-me-later and other payment gateways, and other back and front end projects.\n\nReason for leaving: Â The drive from Santa Ana to Los Angeles downtown was killing me\n\n<strong>Job #37: Real Job #32: Senior Developer, Baublebox, Brea</strong>\n\nI took the job at Baublebox because it seemed like a good opportunity. Â The site was very similar to Hautelook (flash sales) but only a few months old. Â They also said I would pretty much be the CTO when the company got bigger and they offered me stock options. Â Things went downhill very quick. Â The owner had some ridiculous expectation of improving sales by 70% month to month and I could tell that either this would not happen, or it would and the site would not be able to handle it. Â After a few weeks I determined that the site was so horribly written that it needed to pretty much be thrown out and a new one started, however with my team of one other partially qualified developer this was not going to happen in the time needed. Â I literally took the first job that I was offered just to get out. Â (Stay tuned to a future blog where I go into the details of why this site was so bad)\n\nReason for leaving: When faced with impossibl\n\n<strong>Job #38: Real Job #33: Senior Developer: PlatinumMD/SkyCare EHR, Santa Ana</strong>\n\nSkyCare (the new name for the company/software) is a full featured web-based Electronic Health Records application. Â This is where I am currently working so i\'ll leave the details to my resume. Â Suffice it to say that the company/software is going through some big changes and a massive re-design which is all for the better. We will be using new technologies (Node, MongoDB and others) to build a better system. Â I love this team.\n\n&nbsp;', 'The List', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2-autosave-v1', '', '', '2013-09-02 18:09:16', '2013-09-02 18:09:16', '', 2, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=7', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Â It was not an official paying job but at the end of each class every student would tip me, I usually went home with around $40 which was pretty good for me at the time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Â No more work.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #4: (first real w2 type job): Receptionist, Aquarian Realty, Anaheim, Age 18</strong>\r\n\r\nI was the receptionist for a small real estate office headed by a very very old lady (like in her 90\'s) For her i answered phones, and transcribed messages (she could barely hear anything).\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Her son took over the business and tried to make me a telemarketer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #5: Real Job #2: Receptionist/Telemarketer, Â Amaro Reality, Anaheim, Age 19</strong>\r\n\r\nI left Aquarian for what I thought was another receptionist job but it also turned out to be telemarketing. Â I didn\'t stay long.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: isn\'t it obvious?\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #6: Real Job #3: Telemarketer, Harrison Marketing, Tustin Age 19</strong>\r\n\r\nI had some friends already working for this company and they said it was a good deal, at least they paid more than minimum wage (i thing $7/hour). Â It was alright, selling insurance and that kind of thing. Â I stayed for a few months.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I really don\'t like telemarketing\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #7: Real Job #4: Warehouse worker, American Security Systems (somewhere around age 19-20)</strong>\r\n\r\nJust a guy in a warehouse, loading boxes and stuff.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I\'m five-foot-four and not muscular, this was not my type of job\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #8: Real Job #5: Tester, Peryam and Kroll, Anehiem (this is where i\'m going to stop saying my age because well...)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a company that does market research by inviting people to test certain products, lets see i tested whiskey, some crackers and other stuff, i can\'t remember.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t quit, I just stopped being qualified for the focus groups demographics\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #9: Real Job #6: CAD/Draftsman, McDonnell Douglas Commercial Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nI got this job because when I was a kid a designed a lot of my own model airplane plans, I used those drawings to get the job. Â I worked on the MD-11 project on physical drawings/scripcoat and then later in CAD using Unigraphics Unix based CAD software (I was trained on the job). I worked here about a year.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t, but the company got taken over and my position/department removed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #10: Real Job #7: CAD/CAM, Boeing Corp Military Aircraft Division, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nMy old boss from McDonnell Douglas started a new team doing mostly computer aided modeling of parts for the C-17 Cargo Plane, I was selected along with most of the people from my old department to work on the new project. I did a lot of structural models as well as some electrical.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: After 3 years of working in the aircraft industry I decided this is not the path I wanted to take in life (my Father and Uncle were both in the same industry and it didn\'t treat them well) so I quit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #11: Real Job #8: Night Manager, Tower Records, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nI got a job at Tower records because I was in a locally successful band and wanted to work with what I love (Music). I started as a clerk and quickly rose up the ranks to Night Manager.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I didn\'t really quit, i just got hired by another store\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #12: (not a real job): Musician, all over the place.</strong>\r\n\r\nI got paid for my first music gig when i was in a band called \"The Dallas Project\", Since then I have been paid for a number of gigs right up to this day (we got paid a few weeks ago to play a show).\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I will never quit this job.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #13: Real Job #9: Clerk, A&amp;S Bargain Books, Buena Park</strong>\r\n\r\nJust working the cash register/stocking books at this really cheap book store, Â I did this job at the same time as I worked at Tower Records which was right across the street, it was part-time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The store closed\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #14: Real Job #10: Buyer, Tower Records, Long Beach</strong>\r\n\r\nI got hired as the book Buyer for the long beach Tower Records, it was a pretty cool job. Â I got to select all the books that the store carried and got in good with corporate management etc...\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I wanted more out of my life, so I moved back in with my dad in Fullerton and started going back to school to get (another) degree.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #15: Real Job #11: Supervisor, Warehouse Music, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nI needed to make money while I went back to college so I got this job because of my prior experience. It was ok.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I seriously can\'t remember\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #16: Real Job #12: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Placentia</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was a second job that i had while working at the Warehouse. It was good money/part time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: probably car trouble, I can\'t remember.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #17: (not a real job): Editor In Chief, Fullerton College/Hornet News Paper</strong>\r\n\r\nI did get paid a small amount for being the editor in chief of the paper for a semester. Â I got this job after rising up from contributing journalist through front page editor. (This is where I learned photoshop and layout, yay!)\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I wanted to pursue a story about our department head getting sued for some reason. Â It was the only real news on campus but they wouldn\'t let me. Â When I quit most of the other writers also quit in solidarity.\r\n\r\n<em>Side note: It was around about this time in my life that I started really getting into programming. Â I started by making web pages for myself, my band and other friends of mine for art projects. It didn\'t occur to me at the time that this would lead into a full-on career in the field.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #18: Real Job #13: Merchandiser, Tower Records Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nI went back to Tower Records because I still had a lot of friends there. I stayed for about a year this time I think.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I was offered a better position at Radio Shack.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #19: Real Job #14: Delivery Driver, Papa Johns Pizza, Cypress</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was a second job that I had while working at Tower. Â As you can see I was not lazy.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The Radio Shack job was far away so I quit both to go work it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #20 Real Job #15: Sales Associate, Radio Shack, Pico Rivera</strong>\r\n\r\nI took this job because they said after a few months I would get my own store. Â This is the only reason I took the job. Â It sucked!, I was the only person in the store who actually knew anything about electronics/components or computers so I got stuck selling all the $2 capacitors while everyone else hocked cell phones for big commissions.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I refused to completely rob an old lady by selling here Â a $10 restock old-cellphone and tacking on $90 worth of accessories which she didn\'t ask for. Â I flat out refused to do it. Â I quit this job by going to lunch and never returning. Â Brian Haddad (my old manager who asked me to do this) you are a completely unethical jerk and I hope you are still stuck in retail hell.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #21: Real Job #16: Cell Phone Sales, MCI Wireless, Brea Mall</strong>\r\n\r\nI think I literally got hired at this job on the very same day that I walked out of Radio Shack. Â I was one of those annoying guys in the mall who tries to sell you a new phone when you walk by. Â This job sucked so bad that in the two weeks I worked there I went from being the newest guy to the oldest. Â Literally everyone else in the booth either quit or got fired.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: It sucked, I called a buddy at Crown Books and got a new job.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #22: Real Job #17: Store Manager, Crown Books Whittier</strong>\r\n\r\nFirst, this is not the Crown Books you are familiar with. Â The company A &amp; S Bargain Books simply bought the name after Crown folded. Â Their business model was to move into vacant retail locations with a temporary lease, we would get a good deal on rent but we could get kicked out at any time. Â Our job was to throw as many books on the shelves as possible and sell them before the store closed. Â There was no inventory, no computers, just a price gun and a register. I had about 5 employees and my store stayed open for about a year.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I needed a vacation\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #23: Real Job #18: Paint Department, Home Depot Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was my second job while I worked at Crown Books. Â Because of my father\'s business I was familiar with paint so I got the job. Â It was ok. Â This job was essentially a means to an end (to take a vacation) I was there a few months.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I quit both Crown Books and this job to take a three week road trip across our beautiful nation. Â It was totally worth it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #24: Real Job #19: Delivery Truck Driver, Simpson Buick, Buena Park</strong>\r\n\r\nI drove a stake bed truck all over the LA/OC area delivering car parts to various service shops. Â I enjoyed this job because I was out in the city most of the day.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I had a minor accident, backed into some moron who parked right behind my truck as I was idling, It would have been no big deal but they were going to take the damages out of my check and since I wasn\'t making much in the first place I decided to quit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #25: Real Job #20: Taxi Driver, A-Taxi, Santa Ana</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was my first cab driving job, I worked mostly in the bar districts of either Newport Beach or Fullerton.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The cars were really badly maintained and every time you broke down they would take hours to get to you and then repay you by adding more time at the end of your 24 hour lease (which was useless if you were out of commission during peak bar hours and replenished with extra hours on a Sunday afternoon).\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #26: Real Job #21: Taxi Driver, Yellow Cab, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nA much better company than A-Taxi, I drove for Yellow Cab for 3 years. Â The great thing about cab driving is you make your own hours so it allowed me to do other jobs at the same time.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: In my third year of driving I drove less and less, my other business ventures were more profitable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #27: Real Job #22: Retail, Cost Plus World Market, Brea</strong>\r\n\r\nI had a friend who worked there. Â I worked for a few months but it was boring and didn\'t pay much.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: who cares? really?\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #28: Real Job #23: Small Business Owner, Pearshapeboy Apparel, Fullerton</strong>\r\n\r\nEven though this was my own business I count it as a real job since I had a business license and I paid taxes. Â I set up shop in my dads warehouse with a hand made 4-color T-Shirt press. Â I only made a few thousand dollars with this but it was fun.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: to take over my dads business\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #29: Real Job #24: Phone Sales/Support, Wine Country Gift Baskets, La Habra</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was a seasonal job that I took because friends of mine said it was a good company. Â It was. Â The work was hard/tedious but it paid very well and had a very good bonus plan.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Seasonal and to take over my dads business\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #30: Real Job #25: Awning Graphics Painter, JCI International, Fullerton/Santa Fe Springs</strong>\r\n\r\nThis was what was left of my dads business of 30 years on and off. He had established himself as one of the sole awning graphics manufacturers in the OC area. Â After he took ill i took over the business and ran it for many years. Â My work can bee seen on hundreds of buildings throughout southern California. Â Notable Businesses include, Pulte Homes, Lennar, KB Home, Cost Plus World Markets (ironically), and about 80% of the bars in Fullerton at one point.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: Work was inconsistent, I had gotten married and needed something I could depend on.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #31: Real Job #26: Computer/Office Relocation Services, InnerVision, Orange/LA County</strong>\r\n\r\nThis company specialized in moving offices, Things like tearing down/setting up workstations etc... Â it was ok but not that ok. Â This was my first attempt to get a \"real job\" ie a job in an office.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The job was inconsistent, I got another job\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #32: Real Job #27: Retail, Office Depot, Buena Park</strong>\r\n\r\nJust another retail job. Â I thought somehow this job would get me closer to landing an \"office job\" which is what my goal became. I had it in my mind that if i got into an office things would become easier. Â This turned out to be true.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I got an office job\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nwow, my fingers and brain are getting tired, i\'ll continue this list later..\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The List', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-09-01 23:40:25', '2013-09-01 23:40:25', '', 2, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=14', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Â it was ok but not that ok. Â This was my first attempt to get a \"real job\" ie a job in an office.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: The job was inconsistent, I got another job\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #32: Real Job #27: Retail, Office Depot, Buena Park</strong>\r\n\r\nJust another retail job. Â I thought somehow this job would get me closer to landing an \"office job\" which is what my goal became. I had it in my mind that if i got into an office things would become easier. Â This turned out to be true.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I got an office job\r\n\r\n<strong>Â Job #33: Real Job #28: Webmaster/IT Manager, Vinotemp Wine Cellars, Rancho Dominguez</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is the job that really started my \"Career\". I applied for a job as an Administrative Assistant however it only took them a month or so to realize that I knew a bit about web development so they gave me the job of Â maintaining all of their websites (vinotemp.com, westsidewinecellars.com, winemate.com). I was also put in charge of the local computer network and also responsible for creating all print materials. Â I also connected the system via EDI to several other companies including Home Depot and Walmart. I did the best I could for them working on a very hacked up os-commerce site and I made a completely new winemate.com however it was fairly clear after a year or so with them that they had bigger problems than I could handle so they went ahead and hired a second web developer with much more experience.\r\n\r\nReason for quitting: I was fired for not showing up the day after Christmas (a Friday that year). Â This is the first and only time I\'ve ever been fired from a job. Â They had a company policy of no days off in November and December and I violated that policy. Â It was clearly my fault however I think the real reason they got rid of me is they didn\'t need me with the new developer and I gave them a valid reason. Â I have no hard feelings towards them as they did get me going in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #34: Real Job #29: Webmaster/Marketing Manager, Shaxon Industries, Anaheim</strong>\r\n\r\nShaxon was a mid-sized manufacturing company that primarily made copper and fiber optic cables for a variety of uses. Â I had many duties there including making all the print materials and maintaining several websites. Â Even with all that they gave me work wise I had plenty of time on my hands so in that time I completely re-designed their main site (from scratch mind you, no frameworks). Â The new site I made them was able to be white-labeled (skinned) so that their clients could also use it with their company logo/colors etc.. Â It was much better that the archaic 1990\'s looking site which they still have online now however the owners of the company were simply not interested, It was the general manager who had me working on the project and apparently after I left he could not convince them of the worth of a new site because the old one is still live... Â sad.\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Found a better job where they valued my web design skills\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #35: Real Job #30: Application Developer, After 10 Studios, Santa Monica</strong>\r\n\r\nI started working for this company about a month before I quit Shaxon. Â We were a small web development agency and my first project was the dashboard of a vehicle tracking system used by Viper Smart Start and a few other brand name tracking devices. Â The application grew to be fairly extensive by the time we were done, Integrating with Bing Maps, and with a full customer management/accounting and scheduling component. Â After this project was done I worked on about a dozen other projects including: Guardian Watch (a web/mobile app for emergency responders), Gymji (a social network for gym goers), Push It Poker (a social Poker App) and many more. After 10 is where I first started using object oriented programing techniques and also frameworks like Kohana, Cake PHP and CodeIgniter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the owners of the company over-extended our resources towards the end. Â We had about 60-70 projects and only 3-4 developers in-house so instead of having us develop code ourselves we became project managers for teams of over-seas developers (mainly in Russia). Â I did not like this situation as I love coding so I began to look for a new job after about 2 years. Â The company ended up folding a few months after I left\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Bad management.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #36: Real Job #31: PHP Developer II, Hautelook, Los Angeles</strong>\r\n\r\nHautelook is an online fashion \"Flash Sales\" site meaning that sales are scheduled every day and have a very defined timeline. Â With over $300,000,000 in annual sales after only 5 years in business they are one of the most successful in their market, so much so that they were purchased by their competitor Nordstroms a few years back because Nordstroms (a 100 year old company with 20 billion in annual sales) could not compete.\r\n\r\nWorking for the engineering teem at Hautelook was like working for a bunch of computer science professors. Â They took proper coding standards to the extreme in some cases but for me (not having gone to college for this kind of thing) it was probably the best training I could ever get. I learned about design patterns and Unit Testing and Test Driven Development among other things while using primarily the Zend Framework.\r\n\r\nAnother amazing thing about this company was the culture of learning. Â Once a month someone from the team would have to do a presentation to the rest of the team about something they had learned. Â We even had a two week period where all development stopped and we all (besides the iOS developers) learned how to code in Objective C and make our own iOS apps. Â We did this because there was a disconnect between the iOS team and the rest of development. Â The backend developers such as myself did not understand the data structures that the iOS team required because we had never worked in a strictly typed language. Â This was a very good idea.\r\n\r\nMy major achievement while working for HL was the complete redesign of the returns processing system. Â This system is integrated with the admin site, credit card processing, shipping and warehousing. Â It touches just about every aspect of the site and at last time I checked was processing about $4,000,000 dollars in returns per month. Â I also worked on various shipping/tracking modules, paypal/bill-me-later and other payment gateways, and other back and front end projects.\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: Â The drive from Santa Ana to Los Angeles downtown was killing me\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #37: Real Job #32: Senior Developer, Baublebox, Brea</strong>\r\n\r\nI took the job at Baublebox because it seemed like a good opportunity. Â The site was very similar to Hautelook (flash sales) but only a few months old. Â They also said I would pretty much be the CTO when the company got bigger and they offered me stock options. Â Things went downhill very quick. Â The owner had some ridiculous expectation of improving sales by 70% month to month and I could tell that either this would not happen, or it would and the site would not be able to handle it. Â After a few weeks I determined that the site was so horribly written that it needed to pretty much be thrown out and a new one started, however with my team of one other partially qualified developer this was not going to happen in the time needed. Â I literally took the first job that I was offered just to get out. Â (Stay tuned to a future blog where I go into the details of why this site was so bad)\r\n\r\nReason for leaving: When faced with an impossible to achieve task, change the requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job #38: Real Job #33: Senior Developer: PlatinumMD/SkyCare EHR, Santa Ana</strong>\r\n\r\nSkyCare (the new name for the company/software) is a full featured web-based Electronic Health Records application. Â This is where I am currently working so i\'ll leave the details to my resume. Â Suffice it to say that the company/software is going through some big changes and a massive re-design which is all for the better. We will be using new technologies (Node, MongoDB and others) to build a better system.

(37, 1, '2013-10-06 18:46:18', '2013-10-06 18:46:18', 'So I recently had the opportunity to work on a site built on the <a href=\"http://www.opencart.com/>Opencart</a> open source e-commerce system.  Coming from a site that was custom built with the Zend Framework I was initially pleased with the simplicity of the code.  It was fairly obvious how things were put together and there was none of that object oriented madness that frustrates new developers.  Then I discovered vQmod.  After a day or so with it I was shouting wtf\'s at a regular pace.  Needless to say, I quit the job shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem.  First, you start off with a simple easy to use pre-made site.  Anyone with 6 months coding experience can get it installed and set up, yay! the bosses are happy with your amazing progress.  Then your boss says, \'Hey can you add XYZ functionality to the site?\'.  So you immediately look and see if someone else has already implemented XYZ and wholla! they have.  there is a plugin that uses vQmod! YAY we are all happy!\r\n\r\nThen your boss asks you for another feature, and another... pretty soon you say, \'hey look, here is a site with all of the plugins we can add\'. Bad Idea!  your boss wants all of them but you have no idea what this means for your code because you don\'t understand how vQmod works.\r\n\r\nvQmod seems like a good idea at first.  What it does is simple, whenever a third party developer wants to create a plugin they often have to make changes to the core code.  Making changes to the core code is a bad thing because it makes it impossible to upgrade the core code later on.  So what vQmod does is looks for the part of the core code that you want to change and essentially does a search and replace with the changes that you want. It then creates a new file which is used instead of your core code file so your core code never actually changes.\r\n\r\nThis works great when you have one plugin, but as soon as you add more than one you increase the risk of one plugin\'s changes stomping all over another plugins changes.  The thing your boss doesn\'t realize is that these plugin developers don\'t bother to test their changes against all the other plugins.  In fact it\'s practically impossible for them to do this because every time you add a new plugin you increase the possible combinations of plugins that they have to test.\r\n\r\nNow as you go on adding more and more plugins you start to see more and more bugs, but you boss has gotten used to the quick fix of adding features practically overnight.  This is not going to end well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, my suggestion was that the entire site should be scrapped and a new one built from the ground up correctly.  Object oriented methods may appear to be unnecessary to the naive, but it is exactly those methods which prevents things like this from getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, my opinion of opencart is that its a great tool, if you happen to want exactly what it offers and not much more.  If you actually want specific functionality then don\'t waste your time.  And its important to note that this is not a problem just with opencart, you have similar problems with all the other site-in-a-box solutions (ie gocart, oscommerce, drupal etc..).  \r\n\r\nThere is also the flipside with products like Magento, which really are built correctly, however the problem with these is that they try to solve all problems at once.  What you end up with is an extremely complicated code base that is difficult to maintain/learn.  In the end there is nothing better (IMO) than building a site from scratch (or use a framework like Zend/CodeIgnitor/Symfony) and build it explicitly with the features you want.\r\n\r\n ', 'Opencart and vQmod, wtf?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-10-06 18:46:18', '2013-10-06 18:46:18', '', 36, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=37', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Â This would tend to indicate that increased greenhouse gasses are an effect of global warming not a cause but somehow our ingenious scientists have managed to find the loophole.\r\n\r\nIn other related news, an international panel of reactionists has suggested that mankind immediately turn off all electrical devices, stop flying planes, stop driving, quite your day jobs and start planting kale.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/27/us-climate-ipcc-idUSBRE98L0KD20130927\"/>Reuters: UN Panel Report</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22567023\">BBC: Global Warming Slowdown</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/299/5613/1728.abstract\">Science Magazine: Timing of Co2 and Temperature Changes</a>', 'UN panel 95% certain man is the cause of global warming that may or may not exist!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '20-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-09-29 18:52:53', '2013-09-29 18:52:53', '', 20, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=26', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Coming from a site that was custom built with the Zend Framework I was initially pleased with the simplicity of the code. It was fairly obvious how things were put together and there was none of that object oriented madness that frustrates new developers. Then I discovered vQmod. After a day or so with it I was shouting wtf\'s at a regular pace. Needless to say, I quit the job shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem. First, you start off with a simple easy to use pre-made site. Anyone with 6 months coding experience can get it installed and set up, yay! the bosses are happy with your amazing progress. Then your boss says, \'Hey can you add XYZ functionality to the site?\'. So you immediately look and see if someone else has already implemented XYZ and wholla! they have. there is a plugin that uses vQmod! YAY we are all happy!\r\n\r\nThen your boss asks you for another feature, and another... pretty soon you say, \'hey look, here is a site with all of the plugins we can add\'. Bad Idea! your boss wants all of them but you have no idea what this means for your code because you don\'t understand how vQmod works.\r\n\r\nvQmod seems like a good idea at first. What it does is simple, whenever a third party developer wants to create a plugin they often have to make changes to the core code. Making changes to the core code is a bad thing because it makes it impossible to upgrade the core code later on. So what vQmod does is looks for the part of the core code that you want to change and essentially does a search and replace with the changes that you want. It then creates a new file which is used instead of your core code file so your core code never actually changes.\r\n\r\nThis works great when you have one plugin, but as soon as you add more than one you increase the risk of one plugin\'s changes stomping all over another plugins changes. The thing your boss doesn\'t realize is that these plugin developers don\'t bother to test their changes against all the other plugins. In fact it\'s practically impossible for them to do this because every time you add a new plugin you increase the possible combinations of plugins that they have to test.\r\n\r\nNow as you go on adding more and more plugins you start to see more and more bugs, but you boss has gotten used to the quick fix of adding features practically overnight. This is not going to end well.\r\n\r\nIn the end, my suggestion was that the entire site should be scrapped and a new one built from the ground up correctly. Object oriented methods may appear to be unnecessary to the naive, but it is exactly those methods which prevents things like this from getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, my opinion of opencart is that its a great tool, if you happen to want exactly what it offers and not much more. If you actually want specific functionality then don\'t waste your time. And its important to note that this is not a problem just with opencart, you have similar problems with all the other site-in-a-box solutions (ie gocart, oscommerce, drupal etc..).\r\n\r\nThere is also the flipside with products like Magento, which really are built correctly, however the problem with these is that they try to solve all problems at once.

Â You will need to buy some things, not much, about a hundred bucks will do the trick.\r\n\r\nHow this book is written:\r\n\r\nWhile I could go through all the steps to do everything you need to do in excruciating detail, the reality is that this would not do you much good. Â  This is true because technology is constantly changing. Â The instructions I give you today might not be correct a week from now. Â  What I will do instead is give you general instructions for how I have done the things I am asking you to do. Â In addition I will also give you \"Things to google\". Â The most important tool that I have ever used is by far Google. Â If it were not for Google I would not be where I am today, but most people don\'t know how to properly google. Â I will teach this.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Chapter 1: Â Where am I?</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHow does this internet thing work anyway? Â let me explain. Â You have a computer. Â  Your computer has a thing called a browser. Â A browser is that thing you click on to get to the internet. Â If that thing has an \'e\' on it then it\'s probably called \'Internet Explorer\', if it looks like a blue planet with a orange fox surrounding it then its called \'Firefox\', or perhaps you click on something that looks like a simon-says game, This one is called \'Chrome\'. Â  Your browser is not called \'Google\' or \'AOL\' or \'Yahoo\' or whatnot, these are simply places you go once you are on the internet.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter a name into the browser (like www.google.com, or \"google\") what is happening is you are connecting to another computer somewhere else that has a program on it which gives you the information you want. Â That program is simply a file, or a bunch of files (think a piece of paper with text on it but in digital format) that is saved on that machine. Â That machine is called the \'Host\'. Â The Host machine gives you the file by passing it from one machine to another until it finally arrives at your computer. Â It is your browser which then takes that bunch of text and turns it into what you see on your computer, be it text or images or links or videos. Â The way this file is transferred is what we call the internet and it lives by some fairly basic rules.\r\n\r\nFirst rule is, in order to put something on the internet you have to register your domain. Â The \'domain\' is the thing that you type into the browser (ie www.google.com). Â Only one person can own any one domain name at a time so there exists an international group that stores all the information about who owns what domains. Â That group is called ICANN. Â It generally costs about $10 to register a domain name for one year but sometimes you will see a much higher cost. Â What this means is that someone else already purchased that domain and they are re-selling it for a higher price. Â We call these people domain squatter\'s, or in laymen\'s terms \'ASSHOLE\'.\r\n\r\nSecond rule, is you have to have a computer to store your program. Â You must have a \'Host\' of your own. Â While it is possible to set up your own host, this is a rather difficult task for a newbie so most people choose the option of paying for a host. Â This can cost anything from absolutely nothing to hundreds of dollars a month. Â My experience has shown me that the free sites are not worth the trouble so I suggest you go with one of the relatively inexpensive choices such as www.hostgator.com. Â The one I would avoid is www.godaddy.com. Keep in mind that I am only referring to hosting a site here. Â Godaddy is a great site to register your domain, it just sucks for actually hosting it. Â Another site to avoid altogether is www.networksolutions.com. Â they just suck.\r\n<h3>Here is how you set up your first site:</h3>\r\n1) Go to www.godaddy.com and start brainstorming ideas for the name of your website. Â Type them into the domain search and see if they are available. Â Once you get a good one go ahead and purchase it. Â I suggest only paying for one year at a time and watch out because godaddy will do everything in it\'s power to sell you a bunch of crap that you don\'t really need. Â if you paid more than $20 when it\'s all said and done you did something wrong.\r\n\r\n2) Find a good hosting company (ie hostgator.com) and purchase a package. Â I think mine costs about $7 a month and gives me unlimited storage and domain names.\r\n\r\nOnce you have these two things you have to make them work together. Â What you need to do is make the registrar (godaddy) point to the host. Â How this is done is different for each registrar and each hosting company so you are going to have to do some research. Â In general the thing you are trying to do is point the nameservers from the registrar to the host, which means you need to go to the host to figure out what the nameservers are. Â Here is an example of the nameservers I have from this site:\r\n\r\nns1.hostgator.com\r\nns2.hostgator.com Â  (this is a backup in case the first one fails)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Things to Google:</em></span>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>How to point godaddy nameservers to hostgator site</em>\r\n<em> how to set up godaddy nameservers</em>\r\n<em> can\'t get nameservers to point to hostgator</em>\r\n<em> what are my hostgator nameservers?</em></p>\r\nOf course you will want to replace \'hostgator\' and \'godaddy\' with your registrar and hosting company. Another thing to note about proper googling is simply to not give up. Â You should look at every response, it might take 50 results for you to find the answer to the question. Â When you finally do get the answer take note of the site that you are on because there will be a good chance that you can get other answers from this site in the future. Â  In fact here are some sites that I already know are good.\r\n\r\nwww.w3schools.com: This site is great for beginners, keep in mind that not everything on the site is actually correct however the bulk of it is.\r\n\r\nwww.tizag.com: I love this site. well written. For beginners and advanced\r\n\r\nwww.stackoverflow.com: This is a great site but people get real technical on it. If you ask a question on there you will likely get an answer like \'Um how about reading the manual\'. Remember the part I said about programmers not being very social, you shouldn\'t take offense at these types of responses even though they are aggravating, just ask the question again, or ask for clarification.\r\n\r\nFinal step:\r\n\r\nDepending on your host you will have to do different things to get an actual site up. Â On hostgator you have to add and \'addon domain\' which is something you can do from your control panel when you log in. Â when you do this you are telling hostgator to create a folder called \'yoursite.com\' and that folder is where you will store all of your programs. Â If you can get this far, what you want to do next is create a file in that folder called \'index.html\' and put these words in the file \'Hello world\' then save the file.\r\n\r\nAt this point you should be able to type your domain name into your browser and see \'Hello World\' on the screen. Â Do not get frustrated if this does not happen immediately. Â  Use the tools at your disposal. Â If you are on hostgator you can ask them what you are doing wrong and they are usually very helpful, or ask some programmer friend to guide you.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you do get this working, give yourself a pat on the back and go have a beer. Â Take a break and let this knowledge sink in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Chapter 2: Ok now what</h2>\r\ncoming soon..', 'The Book', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-book', '', '', '2013-10-12 19:00:27', '2013-10-12 19:00:27', '', 0, 'http://dallascaley.info/?page_id=42', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Â You will need to buy some things, not much, about a hundred bucks will do the trick.\r\n\r\nHow this book is written:\r\n\r\nWhile I could go through all the steps to do everything you need to do in excruciating detail, the reality is that this would not do you much good. Â  This is true because technology is constantly changing. Â The instructions I give you today might not be correct a week from now. Â  What I will do instead is give you general instructions for how I have done the things I am asking you to do. Â In addition I will also give you \"Things to google\". Â The most important tool that I have ever used is by far Google. Â If it were not for Google I would not be where I am today, but most people don\'t know how to properly google. Â I will teach this.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Chapter 1: Â Where am I?</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHow does this internet thing work anyway? Â let me explain. Â You have a computer. Â  Your computer has a thing called a browser. Â A browser is that thing you click on to get to the internet. Â If that thing has an \'e\' on it then it\'s probably called \'Internet Explorer\', if it looks like a blue planet with a orange fox surrounding it then its called \'Firefox\', or perhaps you click on something that looks like a simon-says game, This one is called \'Chrome\'. Â  Your browser is not called \'Google\' or \'AOL\' or \'Yahoo\' or whatnot, these are simply places you go once you are on the internet.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter a name into the browser (like www.google.com, or \"google\") what is happening is you are connecting to another computer somewhere else that has a program on it which gives you the information you want. Â That program is simply a file, or a bunch of files (think a piece of paper with text on it but in digital format) that is saved on that machine. Â That machine is called the \'Host\'. Â The Host machine gives you the file by passing it from one machine to another until it finally arrives at your computer. Â It is your browser which then takes that bunch of text and turns it into what you see on your computer, be it text or images or links or videos. Â The way this file is transferred is what we call the internet and it lives by some fairly basic rules.\r\n\r\nFirst rule is, in order to put something on the internet you have to register your domain. Â The \'domain\' is the thing that you type into the browser (ie www.google.com). Â Only one person can own any one domain name at a time so there exists an international group that stores all the information about who owns what domains. Â That group is called ICANN. Â It generally costs about $10 to register a domain name for one year but sometimes you will see a much higher cost. Â What this means is that someone else already purchased that domain and they are re-selling it for a higher price. Â We call these people domain squatter\'s, or in laymen\'s terms \'ASSHOLE\'.\r\n\r\nSecond rule, is you have to have a computer to store your program. Â You must have a \'Host\' of your own. Â While it is possible to set up your own host, this is a rather difficult task for a newbie so most people choose the option of paying for a host. Â This can cost anything from absolutely nothing to hundreds of dollars a month. Â My experience has shown me that the free sites are not worth the trouble so I suggest you go with one of the relatively inexpensive choices such as www.hostgator.com. Â The one I would avoid is www.godaddy.com. Keep in mind that I am only referring to hosting a site here. Â Godaddy is a great site to register your domain, it just sucks for actually hosting it. Â Another site to avoid altogether is www.networksolutions.com. Â they just suck.\r\n<h3>Here is how you set up your first site:</h3>\r\n1) Go to www.godaddy.com and start brainstorming ideas for the name of your website. Â Type them into the domain search and see if they are available. Â Once you get a good one go ahead and purchase it. Â I suggest only paying for one year at a time and watch out because godaddy will do everything in it\'s power to sell you a bunch of crap that you don\'t really need. Â if you paid more than $20 when it\'s all said and done you did something wrong.\r\n\r\n2) Find a good hosting company (ie hostgator.com) and purchase a package. Â I think mine costs about $7 a month and gives me unlimited storage and domain names.\r\n\r\nOnce you have these two things you have to make them work together. Â What you need to do is make the registrar (godaddy) point to the host. Â How this is done is different for each registrar and each hosting company so you are going to have to do some research. Â In general the thing you are trying to do is point the nameservers from the registrar to the host, which means you need to go to the host to figure out what the nameservers are. Â Here is an example of the nameservers I have form this site:\r\n\r\nns1.hostgator.com\r\nns2.hostgator.com Â  (this is a backup in case the first one fails)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Things to Google:</em></span>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>How to point godaddy nameservers to hostgator site</em>\r\n<em> how to set up godaddy nameservers</em>\r\n<em> can\'t get nameservers to point to hostgator</em>\r\n<em> what are my hostgator nameservers?</em></p>\r\nOf course you will want to replace \'hostgator\' and \'godaddy\' with your registrar and hosting company. Another thing to note about proper googling is simply to not give up. Â You should look at every response, it might take 50 results for you to find the answer to the question. Â When you finally do get the answer take note of the site that you are on because there will be a good chance that you can get other answers from this site in the future. Â  In fact here are some sites that I already know are good.\r\n\r\nwww.w3schools.com: This site is great for beginners, keep in mind that not everything on the site is actually correct however the bulk of it is.\r\n\r\nwww.tizag.com: I love this site. well written. For beginners and advanced\r\n\r\nwww.stackoverflow.com: This is a great site but people get real technical on it. If you ask a question on there you will likely get an answer like \'Um how about reading the manual\'. Remember the part I said about programmers not being very social, you shouldn\'t take offense at these types of responses even though they are aggravating, just ask the question again, or ask for clarification.\r\n\r\nFinal step:\r\n\r\nDepending on your host you will have to do different things to get an actual site up. Â On hostgator you have to add and \'addon domain\' which is something you can do from your control panel when you log in. Â when you do this you are telling hostgator to create a folder called \'yoursite.com\' and that folder is where you will store all of your programs. Â If you can get this far, what you want to do next is create a file in that folder called \'index.html\' and put these words in the file \'Hello world\' then save the file.\r\n\r\nAt this point you should be able to type your domain name into your browser and see \'Hello World\' on the screen. Â Do not get frustrated if this does not happen immediately. Â  Use the tools at your disposal. Â If you are on hostgator you can ask them what you are doing wrong and they are usually very helpful, or ask some programmer friend to guide you.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you do get this working, give yourself a pat on the back and go have a beer. Â Take a break and let this knowledge sink in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Chapter 2: Ok now what</h2>\r\ncoming soon..', 'The Book', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '42-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-10-12 18:53:50', '2013-10-12 18:53:50', '', 42, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=45', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The reason we even have a product and a market for this product is essentially because of obamacare (and also the 2010 Digital Health Records Act or some such thing which is technically not obamacare but is generally lumped in when describing obamacare).\r\n\r\nThe reason I say this is that from my experience most doctors actually don\'t want to change anything. They are perfectly happy with sending their prescriptions in a rolled up piece of paper tied to a homing pigeon even though from any sane persons perspective it\'s obvious that it is much more secure to send these prescriptions via the internet (because they can be encrypted and identities can be verified etc, etc etcâ€¦) with the old prescription system you could make 10 copies of your original prescription, go get them all filled and Bob\'s your uncle\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about the new system is that now patients will be able to know how much their insurance will actually cover for any drug they might be prescribed and it will also show them lists of alternative drugs that may be cheaper. And I\'m not just talking about the doctor or office person saying that the drug is covered and then you finding out 6 months later that it actually isn\'t and now have a big bill to pay (which is pretty much what happens now). You will now know for a fact exactly how much will be covered before you ever spend dime one. This coverage information is what we refer to in the industry as a Drug Formulary Check and it\'s a pretty tricky thing.\r\n\r\nSo why then would you suppose that doctors would not want to change to this clearly better system? Â Doctor\'s are smart right? what do they know that we don\'t? Â Well perhaps it\'s because they are familiar with the current system and they know how god-awfully complicated it is. Perhaps they are afraid that the new system will add even more layers of complexity. Â Perhaps it\'s because they spent 12 years learning how to be a doctor and the rest of their lives learning how to navigate this ridicules system and now that they think they understand it, here we go and change everything. Â  perhaps?\r\n\r\nAnyway, we just finished 6 months of hell in rebuilding our electronic prescription system and getting it certified by the government and today is the day that this new system gets rolled out and I\'m the guy doing it. This new version of the system includes the Drug Formulary Check that i mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nUp until this point, however, we\'ve been building our system using test data. Fake patients and fake drug formulary information that we can use to build and test the system, but yesterday at about 5pm I started the download of the real formulary information. Keep in mind we have a blazing fast internet connection when i say this.. The download took over 12 hours to complete! When all was said and done we had over 40 gigabytes of information!\r\n\r\n<em>What is all this info ask?</em>\r\n\r\nWell, lets see, this 40 gigs of info consists of every insurance carriers coverage info for every plan they have for every drug that is made, and relatively speaking there aren\'t that many different drugs out there. What this means is that the system of determining how much you will pay is immensely complex and keep in mind this is not the obamacare system, this is the current non-obamacare system. Â All we are doing is putting it in digital format.\r\n\r\nImagine how difficult it must be to wade through the mountains of paper our current system uses to represent this data, it\'s a friggen miracle that anyone ever gets coverage for anything. Lets put some perspective on this:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Current Insurance Coverage Formulary info = 40 gigabytes</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>A Strand of Human DNA = 4.5 gigabytes of data</strong></p>\r\nThat means that our current insurance system is about 10 times more complicated than the code to create life itself! I don\'t have the numbers but if i had to guess I\'d say that the current insurance system makes all the other works of mankind including the lost library of Alexandria look like a cliff notes for a Hardy Boys novel. It is without doubt the most complicated thing we have ever created EVER!. In hundreds of years when we are flying our battlestars to distant galaxies it will still be the most complicated system ever made ever!\r\n\r\n<em>Why, why! why you ask?</em>\r\n\r\nIt\'s because they don\'t want you understand the system that\'s why. it\'s in their benefit for you to not understand it because they can take advantage of you that\'s way. Â And by they, I don\'t mean Obama and his cronies i mean the insurance industry. Â They are the ones spreading the lies about obamacare and making everyone fear it because it is they who will be hurt the most by changing the current system.\r\n\r\n<em>So what are we to do?</em>\r\n\r\nWell the wheels are already in motion, obamacare is here and i don\'t think it\'s going away. Is it painful to make this transition? yes it is. There will not be an immediate benefit to most people, in fact most people will end up paying more... Â At first that is. Â And this fact won\'t change quickly. It will take a generation for us to sort out the mess that we\'ve created and for anyone to see the real benefits of this legislation but when we finally get to that day it will be worth it.\r\n\r\nBut why is this system better?\r\n\r\nIt\'s better because now all the heavy lifting is going to be handled by computers. Â No longer will there be any ambiguity about whether you are, or are not covered. Â No longer will it take years for doctors to get paid for their work. Â No longer will there be lawsuits over who should pay for what.\r\n\r\nAlso because the new system will handle all the complexity for the doctors and patients, it will become less beneficial for the insurance companies to purposely complicate the system. Â Perhaps they will start to simplify their fee schedules which will make everyone happier.\r\n\r\nImagine if we applied this logic to other things, LIKE TAXES! Â what if there was a computer program where all you had to do was press a button and it would figure out your taxes for you and guarantee that you got the maximum amount of money back using every possible deduction. Â Do you think the IRS would simplify it\'s tax code? Â maybe they would because i\'m guessing the same rule is in effect here.

For decades it was known that the party was in it\'s childhood due to the irrational fears that it had acquired. Much like human children who have been known to hate just about anything (e.g. broccoli, peas and homework) Republicans have also have irrational fears (e.g. gays, blacks and anything that might actually help someone who isn\'t already rich). The question was what age is the party?\r\n\r\nIt\'s well knowns that Dogs live 7 years for every 1 human year but what is the Republican year? Recent actions in congress such as the threat to shutdown the government over obama-care prove that the party has moved beyond irrational fears and is now clearly taking actions which can only be described as \"self destructive\". This kind of behavior is usually only seen during adolescence. Given that the party was founded in 1854 this means that a republican year is roughly 12 human years.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of social scientist agree on this there are some who think the party entered it\'s adolescence years ago. For example some site the parties willingness to support amnesty as a clear sign of self destructiveness given the likelihood that the bulk of these new immigrants would probably vote for democrats. Some even put the transformation as far back as 1992 when the first Bush promised \"No New Taxes\" which was clearly absurd on its face.\r\n\r\nWith the new conversion ratio scientists can now predict that the party will reach adulthood in the year 2073 and become a productive member of the global community sometime in the early 22\'nd century however the latter figure assumes that the typical human child becomes productive in their early 20\'s. By all accounts in the year 2100 human children will not become productive members of the community (or even move out of their parents basements) until they are in their 50\'s.', 'Republican Party officially enters \"Teen Years\"', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '27-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-10-22 15:50:52', '2015-10-22 15:50:52', '', 27, 'http://dallascaley.info/?p=57', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
